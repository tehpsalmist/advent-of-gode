# Advent of Gode

Taking advantage of this year's challenge to hone my Golang skills a little bit. If you see anything you think I am missing in my use of the language, I'm open to tips! :)

Try it out for yourself at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

### Running This Code Locally

Run this project by installing go, installing nodemon and running

```sh
nodemon main.go 23-1-1
```

in the project root, where the final arg follows the pattern {YY}-{day}-{exercise} (YY = 2-digit year, day = 1-25, exercise = 1-2).
